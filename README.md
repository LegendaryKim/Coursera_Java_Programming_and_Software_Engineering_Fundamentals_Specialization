## About This Specialization

Take your first step towards a career in software development with this introduction to Java -- One of the most in-demand programming languages and the foundation of the Android operating system. Designed for beginners, this specialization will teach you core programming concepts and equip you to write programs to solve complex problems. In addition, you will gain the foundational skills a software engineer needs to solve real-world problems, from designing algorithms to test and debugging your programs

## Courses

### [1. Programming Foundations with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS](https://github.com/LegendaryKim/Coursera_Java_Programming_and_Software_Engineering_Fundamentals_Specialization/tree/master/1_Programming_Foundations_with_JavaScript_HTML_and_CSS)
Learn foundation programming concepts (e.g. functions, for loops, conditional statements) and how to solve problems like a programmer. In addition, learn basic web development as you build web pages using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. [By the end of the course, will create a web page where others can upload their images and apply image filters that you create.](https://github.com/LegendaryKim/Coursera_Java_Programming_and_Software_Engineering_Fundamentals_Specialization/tree/master/1_Programming_Foundations_with_JavaScript_HTML_and_CSS/Week4_MiniProject%20Image%20Filters%20on%20the%20Web/miniproject1_filter-5-4-2019)

After completing this course, you will be able to:
1. Think critically about how to solve a problem using programming;
2. Write Java Script programs using functions, for loops and conditional statements;
3. Use HTML to construct a web page with paragraphs, divs, images, links;
4. Add styles to a web page with CSS IDs and classes; and
5. Make a web page interactive with JavaScript commands like alert, onClick, onChange, adding input features like an image canvas, button, and slider.


### [2. Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software](https://github.com/LegendaryKim/Coursera_Java_Programming_and_Software_Engineering_Fundamentals_Specialization/tree/master/2_Java%20Programming%20Solving%20Problems%20with%20Software)
Learn to code in Java and Improve your programming and problem-solving skills. You will learn to design algorithms as well as develop and debug programs. Using custom open-source classes, you will write programs that access and transform images, websites, and other types of data. [At the end of the course you will build a program that determines that popularity of different baby names in the US over time by analyzing comma separated values (CSV) files.](https://github.com/LegendaryKim/Coursera_Java_Programming_and_Software_Engineering_Fundamentals_Specialization/tree/master/2_Java%20Programming%20Solving%20Problems%20with%20Software/Week4_MiniProject%20Baby%20Names/MiniProject) 

After completing this course you will be able to:
1. Edit, compile, and run a Java program;
2. Use conditionals and loops in a Java program;
3. Use Java API documentation in writing programs;
4. Debug a Java program using the scientific method;
5. Write a Java method to solve a specific problem;
6. Develop a set of test cases as part of developing a program;
7. Create a class with multiple methods that work together to solve a problem; and
8. Use divde-and-conquer design techniques for a program that uses multiple methods.

### [3. Java Programming: Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data](https://github.com/LegendaryKim/Coursera_Java_Programming_and_Software_Engineering_Fundamentals_Specialization/tree/master/3_Java%20Programming%20Arrays%20Lists%20and%20Structured%20Data)
Build on the software engineering skills you learned in "Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software" by learning new data structures. Use these data structures to build more complex programs that use Java's object-oriented features. [At the end of the course you will write an encryption program and a program to break your encryption algorithm.](https://github.com/LegendaryKim/Coursera_Java_Programming_and_Software_Engineering_Fundamentals_Specialization/tree/master/3_Java%20Programming%20Arrays%20Lists%20and%20Structured%20Data/Week4_Miniproject%20Vigenere%20Cipher/VigenereProgram)

After completing this course, you will be able to:
1. Read and write data from/to files;
2. Solve problems involving data files;
3. Perform quantitative analyses of data (e.g., finding maximums, minimums, averages);
4. Store and manipulate data in an array or ArrayList;
5. Combine multiple classes to solve larger problems;
6. Use iterables and collections (including maps) in Java.
